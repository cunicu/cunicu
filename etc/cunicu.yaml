#### Interface settings start here
# The following settings can be overwritten for each interface
# using the 'interfaces' settings (see below).
# The following settings will be used as default.

## WireGuard interface settings
#
# These settings configure WireGuard specific settings
# of the interface.

# A base64 private key generated by wg genkey.
# Will be automatically generated if not provided.
private_key: KLoqDLKgoqaUkwctTd+Ov3pfImOfadkkvTdPlXsuLWM=

# Create WireGuard interfaces using bundled wireguard-go
# user space implementation. This will be the default
# if there is no WireGuard kernel module present.

# A range constraint for an automatically assigned
# selected listen port.
# If the interface has no listen port specified, cunīcu
# will use the first available port from this range.
listen_port_range:
  min: 52820
  max: 65535

# A 16-bit port for listening. Optional;
# If not specified, first available port from listen_port_range
# will be used.
listen_port: 51825

# A 32-bit fwmark for outgoing packets which can be used
# for Netfilter or TC classification.
# If set to 0 or "off", this option is disabled.
# May be specified in hexadecimal by prepending "0x". Optional.

# The remote WireGuard peers provided as a dictionary
# The keys of this dictionary are used as names for the peers

    # and usually transmitted out of band
    # to the author of the configuration file.
    public_key: FlKHqqQQx+bTAq7+YhwEECwWRg2Ih7NQ48F/SeOYRH8=

    # A base64 pre-shared key generated by wg genpsk.
    # Optional, and may be omitted.
    # This option adds an additional layer of symmetric-key
    # cryptography to be mixed into the already existing
    # public-key cryptography, for post-quantum resistance.

    # A time duration, between 1 and 65535s inclusive, of how
    # often to send an authenticated empty packet to the peer
    # for the purpose of keeping a stateful firewall or NAT mapping
    # valid persistently. For example, if the interface very rarely
    # sends traffic, but it might at anytime receive traffic from a
    # peer, and it is behind NAT, the interface might benefit from
    # having a persistent keepalive interval of 25 seconds.
    # If set to zero, this option is disabled.
    # By default or when unspecified, this option is off.
    # Most users will not need this. Optional.
    persistent_keepalive: 120s

    # A comma-separated list of IP (v4 or v6) addresses with
    # CIDR masks from which incoming traffic for this peer is
    # allowed and to which outgoing  traffic for this peer is directed.

    # all IPv4 addresses, and ::/0 may be specified for matching
    # all IPv6 addresses. May be specified multiple times.

## Basic interface settings
#

# The Maximum Transfer Unit of the WireGuard interface.
# If not specified, the MTU is automatically determined from
# the endpoint addresses or the system default route,
# which is usually a sane choice.
# However, to manually specify an MTU to override this
# automatic discovery, this value may be specified explicitly.
mtu: 1420

# A list of IP (v4 or v6) addresses (optionally with CIDR masks)
# to be assigned to the interface.
# May be specified multiple times.
addresses:
- 10.10.0.1/24

# A list of prefixes which cunicu uses to derive local addresses
# from the interfaces public key
prefixes:
- fc2f:9a4d::/32
- 10.237.0.0/16

# A list of IP (v4 or v6) addresses to be set as the interface's
# DNS servers, or non-IP hostnames to be set as the interface's
# DNS search domains.
# May be specified multiple times.
# Upon bringing the interface up, this runs `resolvconf -a tun.INTERFACE -m 0 -x`
# and upon bringing it down, this runs `resolvconf -d tun.INTERFACE`.
# If these particular invocations of resolvconf(8) are undesirable,
# custom hooks can be used instead.

## Route Synchronization
#
# Synchronize the kernel routing table with WireGuard's AllowedIPs setting
# 
# It checks for routes in the kernel routing table which have a peers address
# as next-hop and adds those routes to the AllowedIPs setting of the respective peer.
#
# In reverse, also networks listed in a peers AllowedIPs setting will be installed as a
# kernel route with the peers address as the routes next-hop. 

# Enable route synchronization
sync_routes: true

# On Linux, see /etc/iproute2/rt_tables for table ids and names

hostname: my-node

# A passphrase shared among all peers of the same community

# gather a list of candidate endpoints and performs connectivity checks to find a suitable
# endpoint address which can be used by WireGuard

# Enable/disable endpoint discovery
discover_endpoints: true

  # This is useful when you are host a server using Pion on an AWS EC2 instance which has a private address, behind a 1:1 DNAT with a public IP (e.g. Elastic IP).

## Interface specific settings / overwrites.
#
# Most of the top-level settings of this configuration file can be customized
# for specific interfaces.
# 
# The keys of the 'interfaces' dictionary are glob(7) patterns which will be
# matched against the interface names.
# Settings are overlayed in the order in which the keys are provided in the
# interface map.
#
# Keys which are not a glob(8) pattern, will be created as new interfaces if
# they do not exist already in the system.
interfaces:
  # A simple interface specific setting
  # cunicu will set the private key of interface 'wg0' to the provided value.
  wg0:
    discover_endpoints: false

  # No settings are overwritten. But since this is not a glob pattern,
  # A new interface named 'wg1' will be created if it does not exist yet.
  # The same applies to the previous interface 'wg0'
  wg1: {}

  # Create a new interface using the wireguard-go user-space implementation.
