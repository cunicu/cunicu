# Development

cunÄ«cu is written in 100% Go and as such we heavily rely on the awesome tooling and packages for Golang:

-   [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) for release automation
-   [Ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo) and [Gomega](https://onsi.github.io/gomega) for testing
-   [Pion](https://github.com/pion) for its ICE, STUN, TURN implementation
-   [Gont](https://github.com/stv0g/gont) for end-to-end testing in various network topologies

Furthermore use the following services to manage our development:

-   [GitHub](https://github.com/stv0g/cunicu) for source code management and CI pipelines
-   [Codacy](https://app.codacy.com/gh/stv0g/cunicu/dashboard) for code quality checks
-   [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/stv0g/cunicu) for code coverage analysis
