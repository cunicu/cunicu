# Development

wice is written in 100% Go and as such we heavily rely on the awesome tooling and packages for Golang:

- [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) for release automation
- [Ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo) and [Gomega](https://onsi.github.io/gomega) for testing
- [Pion](https://github.com/pion) for its ICE, STUN, TURN implementation
- [Gont](https://github.com/stv0g/gont) for end-to-end testing in various network topologies

Furthermore use the following services to manage our development:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/stv0g/wice) for source code management and CI pipelines
- [Codacy](https://app.codacy.com/gh/stv0g/wice/dashboard) for code quality checks and coverage analysis
