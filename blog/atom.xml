        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello, welcome to the first post in the cunīcu project blog!</p>
<p>While the project is still in its infancy there are some updates in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL;DR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TL;DR</a>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="first-release">First release<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to First release" title="Direct link to First release" href="https://cunicu.li/blog/welcome#first-release">​</a></h3>
<p>We are planning to publish the first official release within the next 4-10 weeks 🎉.
The release pipeline, packaging and self-update feature and more has already been implemented.
We just need to finish the last features and do quite some more testing.</p>

<p>The project has now its dedicated <a href="https://cunicu.li/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cunicu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub organization</a> and Twitter handle (<a href="https://twitter.com/cunicuVPN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@cunicuVPN</a>).
Feel free to follow us there for updates!</p>
<p>You might also have realized that the project name has changed. We decided to rebrand from the previous name <em>wice</em> to avoid any potential trademark issues with the WireGuard project as well as another small German company named <em>WICE</em>.
The project name <em>cunīcu</em> [kʊˈniːkʊ] is derived from the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cuniculus#Latin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latin noun cunīculus</a> which means rabbit, a rabbit burrow or underground tunnel. We have choosen it as a name for this project as <em>cunīcu</em> builds tunnels between otherwise hard to reach network locations.</p>
<p>This also gave us the opportunity to redesign the logo which you find further down in the sticker design.</p>

<p>We have stickers! Just drop me a mail at <a href="mailto:info@cunicu.li" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">📧 info@cunicu.li</a> and I will send you some or talk to me at some of the upcoming conferences.</p>
