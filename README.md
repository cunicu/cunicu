## ðŸš§ É¯ice is currently still in an Alpha state and not usable yet

[É¯ice][wice] is a user-space daemon managing [Wireguard][wireguard] interfaces to establish peer-to-peer connections in harsh network environments.

It relies on the [awesome](https://github.com/pion/awesome-pion) [pion/ice][pion-ice] package for the interactive connectivity establishment as well as bundles the Go user-space implementation of Wireguard in a single binary for environments in which Wireguard kernel support has not landed yet.

## Getting started

To use É¯ice follow these steps on each host:

1.  Install É¯ice: `go install riasc.eu/wice/cmd/wice@latest`
2.  Configure your Wireguard interfaces using `wg`, `wg-quick` or [NetworkManager](https://blogs.gnome.org/thaller/2019/03/15/wireguard-in-networkmanager/)
3.  Start the É¯ice daemon by running: `sudo wice daemon`

Make sure that in step 2. you have created Wireguard keys and exchanged them by hand between the hosts.
É¯ice does not (yet) discover available peers. You are responsible to add the peers to the Wireguard interface by yourself.

After the É¯ice daemons have been started, they will attempt to discover valid endpoint addresses using the ICE protocol (e.g. contacting STUN servers).
These _ICE candidates_ are then exchanged via the signaling server and É¯ice will update the endpoint addresses of the Wireguard peers accordingly.
Once this has been done, the É¯ice logs should show a line `state=connected`.

## Documentation

Documentation of É¯ice can be found in the [`docs/`](./docs) directory.
