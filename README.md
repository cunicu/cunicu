## ðŸš§ cunÄ«cu is currently still in an Alpha state and not usable yet

[cunÄ«cu][cunicu] is a user-space daemon managing [WireGuardÂ®][wireguard] interfaces to establish a mesh of peer-to-peer VPN connections in harsh network environments.

To achieve this, cunÄ«cu utilizes a signaling layer to exchange peer information such as public encryption keys, hostname, advertised networks and reachability information to automate the configuration of the networking links.
From a user perspective, cunÄ«cu alleviates the need of manual configuration such as exchange of public keys, IP addresses, endpoints, etc..
Hence, it adopts the design goals of the WireGuard project, to be simple and easy to use.

Thanks to [Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Connectivity_Establishment), cunÄ«cu is capable to establish direct connections between peers which are located behind NAT firewalls such as home routers.
In situations where ICE fails, or direct UDP connectivity is not available, cunÄ«cu falls back to using TURN relays to reroute traffic over an intermediate hop or encapsulate the WireGuard traffic via TURN-TCP.

It relies on the [awesome](https://github.com/pion/awesome-pion) [pion/ice](pion-ice) package for ICE as well as bundles the a Go user-space implementation of WireGuard in a single binary for systems in which WireGuard kernel support has not landed yet.

With these features, cunÄ«cu can be used to quickly build multi-agent systems or connect field devices such as power grid monitoring infrastructure into a fully connected mesh.
Within the [ERIGrid 2.0 project](https://erigrid2.eu), cunÄ«cu is used to interconnect smart grid laboratories for geographically distributed simulation of energy systems.
