# Contributions

cunicu is a community-driven Open Source project.
At this point there are no companies backing the project or influencing the direction of the project motivated by the economic interests.
We are a group of free software enthusiast who strive to build the best performing, always-working and most secure VPN mesh network.
We mostly work on cunicu as a side project in our spare time for fun.

As such, the project has certain freedoms that we want to embrace and see as an important advantage over other commercial solutions:

- **Decentralized:** Our architecture does not require a central management server. And this not only for technical reasons but also from an economic point of view, since as an open source project we are not dependent on having to bind our users as customers. 

- **Healthy rejection of feature creep:** We have the freedom to reject features that are in demand. Cunicu is a decentralized mesh VPN. As an open source project, we have set ourselves a clearly defined goal. Unlike companies, we are not forced to integrate auxiliary functions into our solution as soon as they are requested by customers
