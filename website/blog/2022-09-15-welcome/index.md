Hello, welcome to the first post in the cunīcu project blog!

While the project is still in its infancy there are some updates in [TL;DR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL;DR).

### First release

We are planning to publish the first official release within the next 4-10 weeks 🎉.
The release pipeline, packaging and self-update feature and more has already been implemented.
We just need to finish the last features and do quite some more testing.

### Website, Docs and Twitter

The project has now its dedicated [website](https://cunicu.li), [GitHub organization](https://github.com/cunicu) and Twitter handle ([@cunicuVPN](https://twitter.com/cunicuVPN)).
Feel free to follow us there for updates!

You might also have realized that the project name has changed. We decided to rebrand from the previous name _wice_ to avoid any potential trademark issues with the WireGuard project as well as another small German company named _WICE_.
The project name _cunīcu_ \[kʊˈniːkʊ\] is derived from the [latin noun cunīculus](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cuniculus#Latin) which means rabbit, a rabbit burrow or underground tunnel. We have choosen it as a name for this project as _cunīcu_ builds tunnels between otherwise hard to reach network locations.

This also gave us the opportunity to redesign the logo which you find further down in the sticker design.


### Stickers

We have stickers! Just drop me a mail at [📧 info@cunicu.li](mailto:info@cunicu.li) and I will send you some or talk to me at some of the upcoming conferences.
