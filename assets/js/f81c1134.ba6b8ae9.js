We decided to rebrand from the previous name _wice_ to avoid any potential trademark issues with the WireGuard project as well as another small German company named _WICE_.\\nThe project name _cun\u012bcu_ \\\\[k\u028a\u02c8ni\u02d0k\u028a\\\\] is derived from the [latin noun cun\u012bculus](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cuniculus#Latin) which means rabbit, a rabbit burrow or underground tunnel. We have choosen it as a name for this project as _cun\u012bcu_ builds tunnels between otherwise hard to reach network locations.\\n\\nThis also gave us the opportunity to redesign the logo which you find further down in the sticker design.\\n\\n\\n### Stickers\\n\\nWe have stickers! Just drop me a mail at [\ud83d\udce7 info@cunicu.li](mailto:info@cunicu.li) and I will send you some or talk to me at some of the upcoming conferences.\\n\\n<figure>\\n    <center>\\n        <img src=\\"/img/cunicu_sticker.svg\\" alt=\\"The sticker design\\" style={{transform: \\"rotate(270deg)\\"}} />\\n        <figcaption>The sticker design</figcaption>\\n    </center>\\n</figure>"}]}}')}}]);
